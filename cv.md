## Objective
My goal is to become a Javascript programmer. JS was chosen to start with because I came across it in my daily work. Plus, it's versatile. In the future, I plan to expand my knowledge of programming and constantly improve. 2022 has shown how important it is to be independent from the state if you live in Russia. I hope the profession of a programmer will give me this independence.
